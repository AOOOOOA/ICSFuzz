### Launch ICSFuzz
1. Installing the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Testing scenario Follow Leading Bicycle
```
sh launch_all_FLB.sh
```
Note: This configuration runs Carla in windowed mode. For headless operation, modify the launch_all_FLB.sh script by replacing '-windowed' with '-RenderOffScreen'.

Output will be displayed both in the terminal and saved to result_txt/FLB.txt for you to refer.

3. Testing scenario Lane Change:
```
sh launch_all_LC.sh
```

**We currently offer two sample scenarios for demonstration. Upon acceptance of our paper, we will release additional commands and comprehensive results.**

### Note:
If you encounter an error related to launching Carla when running either launch_all_FLB.sh or launch_all_LC.sh, please make the following adjustment:

In both launch_all_FLB.sh and launch_all_LC.sh scripts, locate the launch_carla function. Within this function, find the line that reads "sh carla/CarlaUE4.sh". Replace this line with the full, correct path to your Carla installation path. 

For example, if Carla is installed in /home/user/CARLA_0.9.13, you would modify the line to:
sh /home/user/CARLA_0.9.13/CarlaUE4.sh


Following the installation steps carefully will greatly reduce the chance of encountering this issue. If you still face any problems, please report them, and I'll assist you promptly!
